NTK is a fork of FLTK 1.3.0 which adds graphics rendering via
Cairo, support for transparent/overlapping widgets, streamlining
of internals, and some new/improved widgets.

# LICENSING #

# Building #

# Dependencies #
     cairo
     gcc-libs
     fontconfig
     glibc
     libfreetype.so=6-64
     libjpeg
     libpng

NTK uses the 'waf' build system.
     
     Type:
         ./waf configure --help 
         
to see compilation options.

Building and installing generally goes like:

     ./waf configure
     ./waf
      su -c './waf install'

# Usage #

NTK uses pkg-config for publishing library information.

If your pkg-config cannot find the library which is installed by default to: /usr/local/lib
and the *.pc files in folder: /usr/local/lib/pkgconfig you may need to add to the PKG_CONFIG_PATH.

     export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig:$PKG_CONFIG_PATH
     
If you have a runtime error indicating that the libntk*.so cannot be found then you may need to
add to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

     export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib

To make the change permanent add the export(s) to your ~/.bashrc file.

Depending on your distribution, to make the export permanent, the export command may need to be
set in a different location.
